Got a weber DGAS38 carb to replace the 32/36 progressive. Cleaned, kitted and initial jetting done. She runs, but will be taking it to get properly tuned.

Interior is not in too bad a shape. Decent clean made a nice difference.   
Got some nice leather-look seat covers. Removed seats, patched up holes.  
Fitted seat covers but used some wire and thread to make sure they tuck in nicely.  Will redo upholstry later.

Next step is to fix some minor issues and put her through roadworthy.  Will be working on that in the next few weeks, but will be driving her in the meantime at least :D
